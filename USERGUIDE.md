# Google Trends Rank Meter

This tool allows you to build a query to retrieve data from the Google Trends dataset. You can compare the rank of the dataset with any other field you want and add a customized condition from the query conditions section. Simply select all the fields you need and choose the option that best fits your needs. Then, enter the value that you need.

Finally, you can add a termination clause to order the data, limiting or sorting it by the field of your choice. **Highly recommended to add a limit for the query.** Have fun!!
